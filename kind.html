    Kindness is a behavior marked by ethical characteristics, a pleasant disposition, and concern and consideration for others. It is considered a virtue, and is recognized as a value in many cultures and religions (see ethics in religion).[1]
    In Book II of "Rhetoric", Aristotle defines kindness as "helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped".[2] Nietzsche considered kindness and love to be the "most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse".[3] Kindness is considered to be one of the Knightly Virtues.[4] In Meher Baba's teachings, God is synonymous with kindness: "God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine His unbounded kindness

<p>
  In human mating choice, studies suggest that both men and women value kindness and intelligence in their prospective mates, along with physical appearance, attractiveness, social status, and age.
A "nice guy" is an informal and usually stereotypical term for an (often young) adult male who portrays himself as gentle, compassionate, sensitive, and/or vulnerable. The term is used both positively and negatively.
 When used positively, and particularly when used as a preference or description by someone else,<br> 
it is intended to imply a male who puts the needs of others before his own, avoids confrontations, does favors, gives emotional support, 
tries to stay out of trouble, and generally acts nicely towards others.In the context of a relationship, it may also refer to traits of honesty, loyalty, romanticism, courtesy and respect. When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive,
 does not express his true feelings.
